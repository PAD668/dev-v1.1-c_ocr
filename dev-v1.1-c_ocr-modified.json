According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \" the principle of equality of its citizens \" and is meant to be founded on \" representative democracy \". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission ' s wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \" qualified majorities \" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \" democratic deficit \" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post - war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens ' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and 8obmit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a fokthek right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in mem6ek states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \" degressively proportional \" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party 1ine8: the conservative European People ' s Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti \u00e9cologiste \" Les Verts \" v Parliament that thi8 was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament ' s powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two - thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999 ). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow.

He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled t0 plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a doty to consider his claim to make a reference if there wuold be no appeal against its decision.

A member state could \" not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails. \" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less pk0doctive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union uf monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \" endgame \" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free tkade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly worrek8, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing 1aw8 on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement.

The EU manages imports from non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Da88unvi1le the Cuort 0f Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate uf origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French fakmek vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding ke9oikement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en kuute to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court uf Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately.

For such \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. 1n the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health ondek TFEU article 36, 6ecao8e stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. 1n Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Ee19ian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infkin9ed article 34, and was not jo8tified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chuc01ate \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". A11 Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it woo1d have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \".

The Court of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from anuthek member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials f0k skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \" the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] tu penetrate \" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the C0ort suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fa11 within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to local habits and customs \" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory \" race to the bottom \", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 293, "text": "Keck and Mithouard"}, {"answer_start": 293, "text": "Keck and Mithouard"}, {"answer_start": 293, "text": "Keck and Mithouard"}], "question": "Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf59"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 500, "text": "cut throat competition"}, {"answer_start": 492, "text": "prevent cut throat competition"}, {"answer_start": 492, "text": "prevent cut throat competition"}], "question": "The aim of the French competition law was to do what?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1000, "text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini"}, {"answer_start": 1000, "text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini"}, {"answer_start": 1000, "text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini"}], "question": "In which case did the Court of Justice review Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1881, "text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive"}, {"answer_start": 1881, "text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive"}, {"answer_start": 1881, "text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive"}], "question": "Under which Directive did the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5c"}]}, {"context": "Since its f0ondatiun, the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the economic nature 0f the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \" factor of production \". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \" social \" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than ecunumic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household dotie8 in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone ' s material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \" indirect quid pro quo \" for the work he did. Having \" worker \" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \" any person having the nationality of a Member State \" (TFEU article 20 (1) ), has rights tu seek work, vote in local and European elections, 6ot more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people ' s jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time ). Nevertheless, practically \" all available research finds little impact \" of \" labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers \".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 171, "text": "the European Community"}, {"answer_start": 171, "text": "the European Community"}, {"answer_start": 171, "text": "the European Community"}], "question": "Which entity focused upon the free movement of workers?", "id": "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e75"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1028, "text": "Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie"}, {"answer_start": 1028, "text": "Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie"}, {"answer_start": 1028, "text": "Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie"}], "question": "In which case did a German man claim the right to live in Netherlands where he was a volunteer plumber?", "id": "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e77"}]}, {"context": "The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can tare up employment, c0nc1ode contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean - Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer fkum R. F. C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it wa8 \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the mea8oke was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. 1n Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mk Weigel ' s claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the mattek it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \" closely linked to the socio - economic situation \" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full - time in Germany but was resident in Austria could.

In Gebhard v Consiglio dell \u2019 Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be \" established \" means to participate in economic life \" on a stable and continuous basis \", while providing \" services \" meant pursuing activity more \" on a temp0kaky basis \". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council fuk not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom.

All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self - employed, or \" undertakings \" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \" vertical \" and \" horizontal \" direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a 1awyek to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only peup1e established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed 8he should be reimbursed 6y Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold ca11in9 customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services fkum a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent.

This meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands with0ot first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxe8 as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not va1id1y incorporated in Germany.

This precludes the need for a dedicated path tu help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power - hungry content - addressable memory. Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection - oriented system has to do in connection set - up, but with less information as to the application ' s requirements. At the destination, the original message / data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to o8e any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPE) provides conventional HDLC - type 1inr management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the O81 Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer twu of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - nude layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed acko8s the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X. 25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw - Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> <Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995 >", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2880, "text": "A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS"}, {"answer_start": 2910, "text": "run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS"}, {"answer_start": 2910, "text": "run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS"}], "question": "What is a typical configuration", "id": "57263b1638643c19005ad336"}]}, {"context": "ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

Living in the 4oth century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst uther8 describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially cuppek vitriol, and also lead compounds.

The term \" Imperialism \" wa8 originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \" imperialism \" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self - inteke8t, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exekted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand inve8tment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a p01icy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.
